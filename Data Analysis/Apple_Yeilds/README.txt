This project was made by numpy, 
The Credits for the data is given to BirajCoder on GitHub
(link of the Data- 'https://gist.github.com/BirajCoder/a4ffcb76fd6fb221d76ac2ee2b8584e9/raw/4054f90adfd361b7aa4255e99c2e874664094cea/climate.csv')

The Goal of this project is to calculate the yeild of apples from the data given
I am expressing the yield of apples as a weighted sum of the temperature, rainfall, and humidity(as shown in the data). 

1)I will pull the csv file from Github and save it as a text file, After this convert the whole data into an array matrix.

2)I will take the whole array matrix and matrix-multiply it with weights(as given in the code).

3)Now I will concatenate the result with the array matrix with axis=1 concatenation(horizontal) and save the data into a new text file.

4)The processed data will be seen as climate_results.txt
